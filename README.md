# Playing Card Bingo

All you need is a couple of phones and a standard 52 card deck of playing cards. Shuffle the deck, flip 1 card at a time and have players tap their screen to follow along as they match cards. When someone scores bingo you'll hear the airhorn sound and it the tiles will flash.  Press and hold the center tile for several seconds to reset the board for the next round.
